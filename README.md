# Clock
 My solution for the Exercism rust/clock exercise

My code is strictly in `src/lib.rs`.

The code in `src/lib.rs` adheres 100% to all tests in `tests/clock.rs`.

### https://exercism.io/tracks/rust/exercises/clock Implementation Instructions
>Implement a clock that handles times without dates.
>
>You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.
>
>Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.
>
### Rust Traits for .to_string()
>
>Did you implement .to_string() for the Clock struct?
>
>If so, try implementing the Display trait for Clock instead.
>
>Traits allow for a common way to implement functionality for various types.
>
>For additional learning, how would you implement String::from for the Clock type?
